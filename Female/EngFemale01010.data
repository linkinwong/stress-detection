um
I
think
communications
play
a
very
important
role
in
helping
me
to
get
along
with
other
people
uh
you
need
to
express
yourself
very
clearly
and
try
to
understand
others
uh
from
their
perspective
--
um
compared
to
high
school
I
think
I
prefer
college
life
and
the
way
people
try
to
get
along
with
each
other
here
--
um
I
get
along
pretty
well
with
local
students
because
I
speak
Cantonese
natively
and
I
think
I
would
have
not
that
many
difficulties
in
intergrating
into
Hong
Kong
society
um
but
definately
I
prefer
Hong
Kong
over
my
home
town
because
this
is
a
more
global
society
for
me
and
I
meet
different
groups
of
people
from
everywhere
and
I
think
I
have
a
lot
of
close
friends
uh
since
I
came
to
Hong
Kong
