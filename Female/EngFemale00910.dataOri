uh I think I get along with people quite well compared to highscool it's -- well I don't really compare them so I can't say which one's better uh I guess I can get along with local students but I don't really hang out with them I think I can integrate into Hong Kong society maybe but I guess I'll always be the foreigner um I definately prefer Seoul than Hong Kong because Hong -- I find Hong Kong too small and crowded and I do have close friends here.
