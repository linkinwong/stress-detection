Work
is
going
okay
I
guess
I
don
--
I
have
some
deadlines
to
catch
for
a
few
of
my
courses
but
they're
not
too
soon
and
I'm
not
too
stressed
about
it
because
I
know
I
get
the
work
done
.
um
I'll
take
I
guess
three
years
to
graduate
--
and
uh
wait
--
I
have
a
quiz
coming
up
next
month
and
no
im
fine
.
