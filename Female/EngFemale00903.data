I
grew
up
mostly
in
korea
but
I've
also
lived
in
Canada
and
Shanghai
so
I
don't
really
h
--
have
a
home
town
um
but
I
would
say
that
I
--
I
woul
--
when
I
introduce
myself
to
people
I
say
that
I
am
from
Korea
--
and
for
Ko
--
uh
Korea
I
would
recommend
people
to
try
out
the
food
and
also
the
culture
there
because
it's
quite
different
from
other
asian
countries
um
and
Hong
Kong
is
not
my
home
town
because
this
is
my
second
year
living
here
