My
plan
right
after
graduation
is
go
on
a
three
month
--
atleast
three
month
journey
with
my
friends
all
around
the
world
.
um
Yes
currently
I'm
looking
for
a
graduation
job
and
so
far
I
haven't
got
any
interview
yet
and
--
but
I
think
I'm
well
prepared
for
the
interviews
especially
for
the
case
crack
for
um
consulting
management
firms
--
and
my
weakness
for
uh
looking
for
jobs
I
think
it
comes
down
to
my
academic
record
because
here
in
Hong
Kong
things
are
very
competitive
and
people
around
me
they're
all
having
very
good
academic
records
so
it's
pretty
hard
to
stand
out
in
that
sense
.
um
I
probably
don't
want
to
study
further
I
want
to
continue
working
here
in
Hong
Kong
.
