Well
I
was
born
in
Hong
Kong
technically
but
I
think
of
Cape
town
,
South
Africa
as
my
home
town
and
specialities
in
South
Africa
wud
--
that
would
definately
be
um
wine
.
Wine
is
the
big
export
of
South
Africa
as
well
as
--
w
--
we
eat
alot
of
meat
the
--
the
--
the
stereotype
about
south
african
males
is
that
they
--
they
barbeque
a
lot
of
meat
although
we
don't
call
it
barbeque
we
call
it
braai
.
uh
What
--
what
i
would
recommend
is
--
is
a
holiday
in
South
Africa
definately
uh
anybody
whose
been
to
South
Africa
on
--
o
--
on
holiday
really
really
love
it
and
--
and
they
recommend
it
to
everybody
else
.
Anywhere
worth
going
well
I'd
say
that
Cape
town
is
the
--
is
the
heart
of
tourism
in
South
Africa
and
right
now
I
prefer
--
I
prefer
my
home
town
because
whenever
--
because
you
always
want
what
you
can't
have
and
when
I'm
in
South
Africa
I
think
about
my
friends
in
Hong
Kong
and
when
I'm
in
Hong
Kong
I
think
about
home
because
my
parents
are
in
South
Africa
and
--
and
you
always
miss
going
home
on
the
weekend
.
