In uh my course since there hasn't been a lot of r- recent work or deadlines or assignments because my courses are mostly introductory for example introductory uh accounting and introductory management and so the concepts are all pretty basic so there hasn't been a lot of uh need to review after classes and it's -- it's only sort a month into the first semester so uh -- so there aren't a lot of assignments right now and there aren't a lot of exams the midterms are still a month away, around uh so -- and there's nothing else particularly difficult because what -- the work that I have right now are mostly presentations and that's what I prefer to uh other writing assignments et cetera
