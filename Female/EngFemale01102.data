The
previous
holiday
I
travelled
around
china
quite
extensively
we
--
we
went
all
around
China
we
went
to
Mongolia
,
uh
((xing
xiao))
,
uh
Beijing
,
uh
lots
of
places
and
after
that
I
went
back
to
South
Africa
where
my
parents
are
and
s
--
so
I
went
home
for
the
holidays
also
--
um
What
did
I
like
about
the
place
well
firstly
South
Africa
is
home
so
uh
so
th
--
th
--
that
in
itself
says
a
lot
and
what
I
like
about
China
was
that
well
it's
--
it's
--
it's
there's
a
sense
of
familiarity
because
I
--
I
speak
chinese
and
a
lot
of
my
relatives
are
in
China
so
when
--
when
I
go
there
it
feels
more
familiar
then
for
example
Hong
Kong
where
everybody
speaks
cantonese
