What courses I think are the most difficult uh well I think what -- what courses I find easier than others are courses where it -- where it requires more understanding I suppose and where the exams are not simply true or false or multiple choice where you can um -- where you can explain your reasoning because then the -- there isn't really a -- a definite right and wrong answer so the courses that I find more -- to be more difficult I think would be those that require a definite answer the more quan -- quantitative subjects
