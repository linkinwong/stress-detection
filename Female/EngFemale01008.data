uh
The
reason
work
has
been
going
well
for
me
I
haven't
got
any
deadline
to
catch
yet
--
and
um
there's
one
course
called
uh
derivative
I
think
it's
a
little
difficult
but
I
just
need
to
read
through
the
textbook((s))
--
and
it
will
take
uh
approximately
nine
months
for
me
to
graduate
and
I
don't
have
to
write
a
paper
so
no
difficulty
for
that
and
no
recent
exams
um
and
I
don't
have
that
much
homework
they
are
pretty
simple
