After
graduation
I
--
I
wanna
look
for
a
job
and
right
now
it's
not
going
very
well
but
I'm
sure
in
3rd
year
it
will
be
better
.
I
don't
have
an
inteview
on
going
recently
but
after
a
couple
of
years
of
experience
I
do
wanna
do
MBA
in
United
States
--
and
my
weakness
would
probably
be
my
lack
of
work
experience
in
my
resume
but
I
do
have
good
communication
skills
.
