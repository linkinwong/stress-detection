The
food
I
like
most
is
ah
tr
--
traditional
cantonese
soup
um
it's
--
it's
the
kind
of
food
that
you
have
uh
--
the
soup
that
you
have
to
make
it
for
like
two
hours
or
so
and
I
like
it
even
the
one
in
our
university
canteen
um
I
don't
know
how
to
make
it
because
it's
really
complicated
and
but

can
really
buy

i
can
buy
it
in

restaurants
