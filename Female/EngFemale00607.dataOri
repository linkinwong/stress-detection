I -- I think i'm going to apply for a graduate school after this i didn't get -- i didn't get any offer yet but hopefully I should get like one or two somehow sometimes, um i wanted to do a masters first and then PHd because I'm not really sure what im trying to do but um i mean masters sounds better than like a five year commission for this, so i think i'm just going to be waiting for the offer and see what happens next
