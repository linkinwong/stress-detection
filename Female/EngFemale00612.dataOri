My parents are really open minded and like they don't really care what I'm doing as long as I like what I'm doing so they don't really give me any pressure, my friends um most of them are fine they're like timid and shy but i do have a few friends that is like ((very sparkling)) and try to like push me to do a lot of things but like i don't really hang out with them so i think that's fine
