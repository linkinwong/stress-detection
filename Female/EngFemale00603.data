ah
My
home
town
is
Beijing
um
there's
nothing
really
special
about
it
,
just
the
capital
city
of
china
I
recommend
people
to
go
to
the
great
wall
,
the
tiananmen
square
um
probably
that's
it
for
beijing
.
I
--
I
prefer
Beijing
than
Hong
Kong
because
it's
bigger
and
people
do
get
like
more
personal
space
than
Hong
Kong
