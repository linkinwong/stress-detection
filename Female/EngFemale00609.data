I
think
um
college
life
is
quite
nice
to
me
I
came
to
this
university
in
civil
engineering
major
but
like
I
changed
my
major
--
I
changed
my
major
in
the
middle
of
first
year
because
I
took
one
electrical
engineering
course
and
I
got
a+
from
that
course
and
then
right
after
I
got
my
like
A+
I
changed
to
--
I
switched
to
electrical
engineering
um
I
do
like
it
and
--
and
right
now
it's
interesting
I'm
not
sure
after
a
while
if
it
is
still
interesting
or
not
