I don't really have a concrete plan after graduation I think it will be a bit hard for me to find a job because I don't really have any concrete work experience or internship experience but i'm not too stressed about it right now and for further study my parents want me to go to law school so I guess I might be doing that as well but nothing really definite or concrete as of yet
