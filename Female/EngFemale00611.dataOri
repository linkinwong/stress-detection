um I'm kind of anxious about my academic life because i'm applying for graduate school right now and like the offer thing didn't go very well I'm still waiting for that but um I really don't know if I can get into one or two this year so im kind of nervous about that and think about that a lot um I'm trying to fix that but I'm not sure if that's going to happen
