I
tried
to
adapt
to
the
college
life
by
staying
around
with
my
friends
who
are
from
mainland
and
we
help
each
other
alot
--
and
um
the
reason
why
I
came
to
this
university
because
it
--
it's
business
school
had
very
high
reputation
in
Asia
and
Hong
Kong
is
a
very
international
and
attractive
city
for
me
--
and
why
((I))
chose
my
major
study
the
reason
is
I
like
economics
and
I
like
the
logic
to
think
in
that
field
