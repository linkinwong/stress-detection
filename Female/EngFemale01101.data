The
most
recent
TV
series
that
--
the
most
recent
good
TV
series
that
I've
watched
has
been
uh
definately
the
new
gossip
girl
the
last
season
of
gossip
girl
,
because
of
well
very
little
people
like
to
admit
it
but
it's
a
--
it's
--
it's
sort
of
a
sinful
pleasure
because
of
all
the
drama
and
because
people
--
and
people
really
indulge
in
uh
seeing
other
people
suffer
in
a
way
it's
--
it's
human
nature
so
um
people
--
people
ar
--
are
a
little
bit
ashamed
of
--
of
loving
gossip
girl
so
much
but
I'm
--
I'm
not
ashamed
of
that
at
all
um
my
favourite
type
of
movies
or
TV
series
preferably
not
the
--
the
blockbuster
action
type
but
more
uh
with
more
drama
and
with
more
sentimentality
