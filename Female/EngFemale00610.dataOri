uh I get along with people quite well but like I normally just hang out with a few of my best friends i'm not like those kind of sociable person that like hang out with everybody so I kind of stick with um two or three best friends. I don't really talk to local people because most of people from hong kong they don't really have the same value as I did, so like normally I don't talk to them but like we're fine um I prefer my home town than Hong Kong somehow because as I said more personal space and everything's larger but I do like Hong Kong
