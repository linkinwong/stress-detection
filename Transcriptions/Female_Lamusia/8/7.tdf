7.wav	0	0.0	23.7301587302	speaker7	female	native	After graduation I-- I wanna look for a job and right now it's not going very well but I'm sure in 3rd year it will be better. I don't have an inteview on going recently but after a couple of years of experience I do wanna do MBA in United States-- and my weakness would probably be my lack of work experience in my resume but I do have good communication skills.	0	0	0
