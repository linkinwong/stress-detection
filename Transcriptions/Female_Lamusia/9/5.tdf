5.wav	0	0.0	20.6746031746	speaker5	female	native	My favorite food is Korean food definately and favorite from the Korean food would be kimchi I know how to make it but it's quite complicated and I've never-- never done it without my mum so no, uh in Hong Kong you can just go to some korean shops or go to the restaurant but they're not really good here so i wouldn't really reccomend it	0	0	0
