7(a).wav	0	0.0	7.85714285714	speaker7a	female	native	My plan right after graduation is go on a three month-- atleast three month journey with my friends all around the world. um Yes currently I'm looking for a graduation job and so far I haven't got any interview yet and-- but I think I'm well prepared for the interviews especially for the case crack for um consulting management firms-- and my weakness for uh looking for jobs I think it comes down to my academic record because here in Hong Kong things are very competitive and people around me they're all having very good academic records so it's pretty hard to stand out in that sense. um I probably don't want to study further I want to continue working here in Hong Kong.	0	0	0
