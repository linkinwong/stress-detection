Wine is the big export of South Africa as well as-- w-- we eat alot of meat the-- the-- the stereotype about south african males is that they-- they barbeque a lot of meat although we don't call it barbeque we call it braai. uh What-- what i would recommend is-- is a holiday in South Africa definately uh anybody whose been to South Africa on-- o-- on holiday really really love it and-- and they recommend it to everybody else. Anywhere worth going well I'd say that Cape town is the-- is the heart of tourism in South Africa and right now I prefer-- I prefer my home town because whenever-- because you always want what you can't have and when I'm in South Africa I think about my friends in Hong Kong and when I'm in Hong Kong I think about home because my parents are in South Africa and-- and you always miss going home on the weekend.	0	0	0
