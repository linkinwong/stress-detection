Okay, um, I am looking for a job uh within the finance sector. And I uh start doing my applications uh online this semester. Application deadlines are very tense and I have to finish them within a month of my first uh semester of my final year. Further studies is something I’ve been thinking about doing two years after working. uh After working I will probably do the ~GMAT and ~GRE, I have it in the back of my head but I’m not doing it right now.	0	0	0
