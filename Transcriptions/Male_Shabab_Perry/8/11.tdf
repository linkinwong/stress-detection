11.wav	0	0.0	33.0643127364	speaker8	male	native	hmm What kind of things am I anxious about I'm not really anxious about employment yet because I have atleast two more years of studying so ofcourse sometimes I think about summer internships and stuff but I wouldn't really say I'm anxious about it. Relationships, love life, well it's more the lack of love life that I am anxious about maybe so but I wouldn't use the word anxious I think it's a pretty strong word. Academic life, not at all, maybe ask me again one day before the mid-term but right now not really.	0	0	0
