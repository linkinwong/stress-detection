3.wav	0	0.0	40.1298701299	speaker3	male	native	Huh, well my hometown it's Hong Kong but you know Hong Kong it's um really stressful and look at ~US -- look at this uni, Hong Kong University of Stress and Tension. I mean I recommend everyone having a life but it's kind of hard when you have so much work in university. Uh, if -- if you're asking me is there anywhere worth going I would say definitely Lang Kwai Fong to chill and you know remove your stress or whatever. And ofcourse I prefer Hong Kong my hometown because I was born here and raised here it's a great city to me and you know you know what I mean.	0	0	0
