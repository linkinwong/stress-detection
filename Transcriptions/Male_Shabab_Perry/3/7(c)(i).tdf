7(c)(i).wav	0	0.0	32.987012987	speaker3	male	native	Well after I finish uh  graduating first  honors in my class uh @UPENN and Harvard offered me uh post graduate position. But I just -- you know I told them no because I want more life experience and I'm pretty sick of studying in just a faculty or anything. I want to go out there reach out to the community what they gave me when I was young and uh yeah that's my reason for  rejecting these top universities.	0	0	0
