Um
my
hometown
is
Seoul
,
Korea
.
Um
I
recommend
ah
you
go
to
eat
some
Korean
food
in
Seoul
.
There
many
new
Korean
restaurants
.
Um
you
can
also
go
to
some
old
palaces
to
--
to
see
traditional
stuff
about
Korea
.
And
I
prefer
my
hometown
over
Hong
Kong
,
because
you
know
it
is
my
country
and
I
feel
more
comfortable
there
.
