My
plan
after
graduation
is
to
uh
look
for
a
job
,
um
so
that
I
can
pay
uh
for
my
bills
.
I
need
to
find
a
job
and
that’s
uh
very
important
for
me
.
Okay
,
um
,
I
am
looking
for
a
job
uh
within
the
finance
sector
.
And
I
uh
start
doing
my
applications
uh
online
this
semester
.
Application
deadlines
are
very
tense
and
I
have
to
finish
them
within
a
month
of
my
first
uh
semester
of
my
final
year
.
Further
studies
is
something
I’ve
been
thinking
about
doing
two
years
after
working
.
uh
After
working
I
will
probably
do
the
~GMAT
and
~GRE
,
I
have
it
in
the
back
of
my
head
but
I’m
not
doing
it
right
now
.
