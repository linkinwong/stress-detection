My plan after graduation is ofcourse take some time off uh absorb everything in that I graduated and that I'm ready for the working environment I'll go take a big trip with my family and my friends just before I start working and basically um get in the mood to -- to work in real life. I've been looking for jobs uh been going through job ~DB's , newspapers and through my parents but um it's coming pretty good I've sent around fifty uh copies of resumes to companies and I've got interview offers from six of them, and without preparing about well tell you what it's all about looking up the company websites updating -- updated on the news of what's happening, press conferences, etc. Uh it's uh pretty hard to find a job um because specially in Hong Kong it's such a competetive market and everyones looking for jobs the unemployment rate is pretty high and it's just you know it's hard. Well my weaknesses, um, I think my weakness is my communication skills since I don't like listening to people and I like doing stuff myself but yeah I can -- I can learn from my weakness I mean I can change to more communication, more effective communication to understand other people's perspectives and hopefully that will um -- that can apply to my real job sooner or later. Well after I finish uh graduating first honors in my class uh @UPENN and Harvard offered me uh post graduate position. But I just -- you know I told them no because I want more life experience and I'm pretty sick of studying in just a faculty or anything. I want to go out there reach out to the community what they gave me when I was young and uh yeah that's my reason for rejecting these top universities. When it comes to studying, well what I think is hardest ofcourse I think that absorbing all the knowledge and -- and uh material is pretty hard but I think applying the real material to real life situations and scenarios is the hardest it's not going to get harder than that because the environment keeps changing and the textbook might not really apply so you have to use your common sense, etc. So yup I made think -- I made my point. How long does it take to graduate, wow that's -- that's a hard question um I think um it really depends on how much you are willing to devote your life to studying for your ~PHD. I mean that is the last level in -- uh in terms of academics and I would yeah yeah.
