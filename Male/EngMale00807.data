uh
After
my
graduation
I
hope
I
can
find
some
sort
of
job
in
Mainland
China
because
I
lived
in
Shanghai
for
two
years
so
it
would
be
nice
to
somehow
practice
my
Mandarin
more
and
um
I
don't
know
I
hope
I
can
work
for
a
smaller
company
where
they
give
more
responsibility
.
uh
I
--
I
don't
want
to
study
anymore
because
I'm
really
fed
up
with
studying
so
I
really
want
to
start
working
.
