Yeah
my
hometown
is
Delhi
and
the
--
what
I
like
about
Delhi
is
that
uh
theres
--
it
has
both
cultural
aspects
as
well
as
the
contemporary
aspects
as
well
.
I
would
recommend
all
uh
--
all
the
people
from
other
countries
to
come
to
this
place
because
it
is
really
beautiful
and
uh
I
would
not
prefer
Hong
Kong
as
my
hometown
I
would
just
prefer
to
study
over
here
I
would
still
love
to
go
back
to
Delhi
.
