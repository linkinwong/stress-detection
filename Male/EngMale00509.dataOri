I think ah uh initially I adapted very poorly to college life because I didn't know a lot of people and I really didn't embrace the Cantonese culture. The reason why I chose this university is because I know that ~UST is very good in its technological side and uh -- and also uh why did I come to Hong Kong is because uh um I had a financial difficulty with my family and if I stayed in Hong Kong it would be a lot cheaper.
