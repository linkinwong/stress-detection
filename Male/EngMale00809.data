uh
I
think
I'm
adapting
to
college
life
pretty
well
because
I've
been
a
student
for
quite
some
time
now
and
I
mean
most
people
here
actually
very
nice
and
it's
not
that
hard
to
adapt
well
and
why
did
I
come
to
this
university
well
I
lived
in
Shanghai
before
so
in
hong
kong
they
have
very
good
universities
and
uh
yeah
I
guess
that's
pretty
much
the
reason
.
