uh
So
my
plan
after
graduation
is
to
actually
start
a
~PHD
in
~US
.
Uh
I'm
not
looking
for
a
job
I'm
applying
for
uh
--
I'm
sending
applications
for
universities
.
uh
I
have
not
received
an
offer
yet
and
what
I
find
the
hardest
in
studying
is
to
write
a
paper
or
report
.
um
it
actually
takes
five
years
uh
--
the
normal
time
yeah
for
~PHD
uh
is
five
years
but
((I
you))
probably
can
finish
in
four
or
three
years
if
you're
really
good
.
