Uh
I
think
I
get
along
pretty
good
with
people
here
I
mean
compared
to
high
school
ofcourse
these
guys
are
more
mature
but
uh
at
the
same
time
there
is
more
diverse
cultures
here
so
you
can
uh

--
you
can
share
your
experieces
,
your
food
,
your
cultures
,
etc
.
When
it
comes
to
local
students
they
are
a
bit
hard
to
get
in
touch
to
because
they
already
have
their
group
of
friends
so
--
but
I
try
--
I
try
integrating
into
Hong
Kong
societies
--
uh
local
society
by
joining
their
events
etc
.
