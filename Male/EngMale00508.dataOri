uh I have -- I have a lot of deadlines to do uh for my ~FYP etcetera also I have a lot of homeworks that I have to do and uh also I have to communicate with uh -- with my ~FYP partner as well and its a bit frustrating sometimes because of the time difference. I think it would take me another -- about a year uh maybe a bit less to -- to graduate. um I haven't started any of my uh writing for my ~FYP. um I have started to study for some of my exams because I know its -- all my exams and mid-terms will be bunched in a group.
