Ah
I
get
along
with
other
people
very
well
.
But
compared
to
high-school
ah
in
here
I’m
kind
of
limit
--
limited
to
um
like
Korean
society
.
Ah
I
do
not
know
how
but
maybe
it
is
because
I
have
girlfriend
and
I
always
hang
out
with
Korean
friends
.
Um
But
I
don't
know
which
one
is
better
.
I
think
both
has
its
you
know
positive
and
negatives
but
I
do
also
have
many
international
friends
as
well
.
Um
I
--
I
do
have
some
local
friends
and
they
are
like
including
my
old
roommates
and
they
are
very
kindly
.
I’m
learning
--
I'm
actually
learning
Cantonese
from
them
.
Yeah
,
I
can
integrate
into
Hong
Kong
society
,
because
I
know
like
I
lived
in
China
for
seven
years
so
--
and
I
also
speak
Cantonese
so
I
can
understand
their
culture
and
everything
better
.
Ah
my
hometown
is
--
well
I
still
prefer
Korea
than
Hong
Kong
I
guess
.
Um
yeah
I
do
have
many
close
friends
here
not
a
lot
but
like
really
good
friend
,
like
five
or
six
.
