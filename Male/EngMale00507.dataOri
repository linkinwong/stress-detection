((My initial)) for after graduation would be to uh find -- find a place where I could do my graduate studies. But if that doesn't turn out uh probably then I will probably do uh -- start finding a job. um I have - haven't started looking for a job. But I have been going to recruitment talks. uh I haven't done any uh interviews. But uh an uh so I don't have any preparation. uh I think it's actually hard to find job because the -- there is a lot of people who are much better suited to the type of jobs I'm -- I'm trying to look for. uh I think my weaknesses would be my work experience and also my internship experience. But uh on other hand my professional knowledge and skills uh will compensate for that and also my communication skills will be a lot better. uh Have I got an offer? Yes uh I have had an my offer and uh it -- it is the one I wanted uh I wanted to go to ~U of ~T. uh What's my hardest uh place for studying I think the hardest would uh again be the mathematical side of everything. um ~PHD how long does it take to graduate? I think it would take around two years.
