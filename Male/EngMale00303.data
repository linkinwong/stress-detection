Huh
,
well
my
hometown
it's
Hong
Kong
but
you
know
Hong
Kong
it's
um
really
stressful
and
look
at
~US
--
look
at
this
uni
,
Hong
Kong
University
of
Stress
and
Tension
.
I
mean
I
recommend
everyone
having
a
life
but
it's
kind
of
hard
when
you
have
so
much
work
in
university
.
Uh
,
if
--
if
you're
asking
me
is
there
anywhere
worth
going
I
would
say
definitely
Lang
Kwai
Fong
to
chill
and
you
know
remove
your
stress
or
whatever
.
And
ofcourse
I
prefer
Hong
Kong
my
hometown
because
I
was
born
here
and
raised
here
it's
a
great
city
to
me
and
you
know
you
know
what
I
mean
.
