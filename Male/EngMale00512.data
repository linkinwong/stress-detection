uh
No
my
parents
--
my
parents
haven't
give
me
any
pressure
but
uh
I
think
my
relatives
have
because
they
--
they've
been
constantly
asking
me
uh
what
I'm
going
to
do
after
my
--
uh
after
graduating
and
also
a
little
bit
from
my
girlfriend
because
obviously
uh
she
--
she
wants
to
have
a
boyfriend
that
a
reliable
in
the
future
.
