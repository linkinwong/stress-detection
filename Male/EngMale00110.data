Yeah
I've
started
to
get
along
with
all
the
people
over
here
.
Um
,
both
the
international
students
as
well
as
the
local
students
.
Uh
,
the
local
students
initially
I
found
it
hard
to
talk
to
them
but
uh
slowly
and
slowly
due
--
due
to
like
cultural
events
and
all
other
stuff
I
got
mixed
with
these
people
and
enjoyed
a
lot
.
Between
my
hometown
and
Hong
Kong
uh
it's
really
tough
to
choose
which
one
I
would
prefer
but
I
like
all
the
aspects
of
the
places
and
I
have
really
close
friends
over
here
and
they
help
me
a
lot
.
