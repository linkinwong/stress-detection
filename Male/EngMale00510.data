uh
I
don't
think
I
did
as
well
com
--
uh
compared
to
high
school
because
uh
during
high
school
a
lot
of
us
came
from
the
same
background
because
a
lot
of
us
were
uh
Chinese
people
and
then
we
lived
abroad
and
then
we
came
back
but
the
loose
--
local
students
are
--
I'm
starting
to
get
used
to
them
and
uh
I'm
starting
to
get
along
with
them
and
uh
I
think
uh
I
have
somewhat
integrated
into
Hong
Kong
society
,
but
I
do
prefer
a
place
that
has
more
English
culture
