Well, as I have made a lot of friends in my university its easy to get along with people. I think uh its better gi --  here in my university than in my high school because I have friends from all different parts of the world. Its quite difficult to get along with the local students because there's a communication problem but if when you -- when you like (()) in the university for quite long its -- its used to for you. Its always very difficult for me to integrate in the Hong Kong society because of their culture -- cultural and the rituals, and its very difficult to choose from in between my Hong -- uh hometown and Hong Kong because every place has it's own value and different criterias.
