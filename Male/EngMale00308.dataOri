How is my recent work going well to be honest um year two work just started uh summer is over and to be -- um its really hard getting it -- getting back into that working routine and mood because I had such a great summer with no work at all so you know I'm starting to manage starting to get more advice from seniors and I do have deadlines to catch which is my first assignment from uh finance which is next week uh I -- I don't find it that difficult because I like to self study in the library a lot so I get the material but uh when it comes to any difficult problems whatever I'll go straight to the professor be honest with her or what -- what -- what is hard and hopefully she can help me out. How -- how long will I take to graduate well this course is -- I'm doing ~BBA and I'm in year 2 so I have one more year to go and uh I hopefully the last year will not be as tough as it is going to be this year.
