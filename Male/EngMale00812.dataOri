um Actually my parents, they dont give me any pressure at all which I think is pretty odd for most Asian people I know that a lot of them they have a lot of pressure from home but I know my mom she can -- she just says that if you don't like university you can come back any time you don't even have to finish graduation I don't give a shit. So, no pressure at all.
